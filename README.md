# ICS499_CapStone_project
INTRODUCTION

This project is for senior students of the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science by Prechar Xiong, Fromssa Olana, Muhammad Shariff, and Christopher Schreiber. The project is done for instructor Dr. Ismail Bile Hassan of Metropolitan State University. Metropolitan State University has a lengthy process for its academic internship application due to its physical application needing 5 physical signatures from different individuals, which is inconvenient; since paper travels slower than electricity. Metropolitan State University needs an electronic internship management system to speed up the academic internship application process.

  The goal of this project is to create an easy and convenient way to apply for the academic internship thatâ€™s available at Metropolitan State University. The Metropolitan State Academic Internship Management System is a web application that provides students, internship faculty members and employers to manage and sign the academic internship applications of students.
